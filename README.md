Overview

This project marks my initial steps into web development. The webpage showcases fundamental HTML concepts such as:

Document structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)

Basic elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images

Semantic tags and clean markup
Technologies Used

HTML5: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

Text Editor: I used Visual Studio Code
 (or any plain text editor) to write the HTML code.

Web Browsers: Tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
